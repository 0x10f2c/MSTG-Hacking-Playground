# OMTG-Hacking-Playground

This app contains different test cases that map to the OWASP Mobile Testing Guide. Goal is to give developers/testers/security researchers an easy way to try out the different ways to analyse an Android App for security weaknesses and bad practices.

Current Draft of the OWASP Mobile Testing Guide (OMTG) can be found here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/132Ose0jdQwN6Z_Fp0VOJtVdGCufIwligwmf6oT0lmK8/edit#
